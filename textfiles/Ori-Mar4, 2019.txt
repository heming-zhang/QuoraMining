What are the best theme music from a movie or a TV series that will never bore you?
 Here are some of the themes that I could never get tired of listening:
What is a song/movie/TV show that has changed the way you think or see things?
 ※The Fault In Our Stars§ and ※Juno.§ The former is a coming of age, falling in love story amidst a terminal illness; the latter is also a coming of age falling in love story amidst a pregnancy. These kinds of movies where such young characters are facing

What are the most cliche character tropes you＊re tired of seeing (movies, books, games, etc.)?
 Any variation on the ※chosen one foretold by prophecy to free their land from oppression§ theme. The mercenary/assassin who hates his job but keeps on (reluctantly?) killing people. They＊ll get no sympathy from me. Buddy cop stories pairing the brash you

Does every movie/TV show use ADR? Are all actors required to dub their dialogue in post-production?
 There is no ※requirement§. The world is not like school where a principal exists who makes rules for you to follow. ADR is the process of rerecording the vocal performance in an audio studio. Generally the video image will be played while the audio engin
Why is Supernatural coming to an end after 15 seasons?
 There are story reasons but it＊s most likely business driven. AT&T bought Warner last year. They＊re restructuring it this year. They＊re launching a WarnerMedia streaming service next year. Right now, the CW shows are more or less bankrolled by Netflix pa

Why is reading considered more intellectual than watching film or TV?
 Partly snobbery: for a very long time, reading was something only the well educated/rich people did. Your average peasant had neither the time nor the money to learn it, and no books to read anyway. So, reading (and owning) books was a way to display you

Which has a better picture quality for watching movies, a monitor or small TV?
 Either work well. High Definition works well on large screens, but on small screens there＊s not a huge difference. I even watch on a tablet, shows on Netflix, and considering that＊s inches from my face, compared to my 32∪ tv which is 7每8 feet away, I don
What effect do you think film and television violence has on people in society?
 I am sure it has a bad effect. In the 1970s there was much less graphic violence on screen. When people fought it was often over quite quickly. Nowadays some screen violence is more brutal and is very detailed and sustained and this must affect people wh
Which live-action television show or movie would you love to watch in a animated version?
 For me, it＊s a close tie between two I think would be hysterical in animated form: Impractical Jokers (2011-) A show about four comedic friends, daring each-other to do whatever the other tells them or otherwise suffer the humiliating and/or painful puni

What TV show do you believe has the best ending ever?
 I would say it was Breaking Bad. I expected the last episode to be a train-wreck trying to tie up all the sub-plots but instead was pleasantly surprised by a very satisfying ending. I would say the worst ending was St. Elsewhere. It turned out the show,

What are the best theme music from a movie or a TV series that will never bore you?
 Here are some of the themes that I could never get tired of listening:
What is a song/movie/TV show that has changed the way you think or see things?
 ※The Fault In Our Stars§ and ※Juno.§ The former is a coming of age, falling in love story amidst a terminal illness; the latter is also a coming of age falling in love story amidst a pregnancy. These kinds of movies where such young characters are facing

What are the most cliche character tropes you＊re tired of seeing (movies, books, games, etc.)?
 Any variation on the ※chosen one foretold by prophecy to free their land from oppression§ theme. The mercenary/assassin who hates his job but keeps on (reluctantly?) killing people. They＊ll get no sympathy from me. Buddy cop stories pairing the brash you

Does every movie/TV show use ADR? Are all actors required to dub their dialogue in post-production?
 There is no ※requirement§. The world is not like school where a principal exists who makes rules for you to follow. ADR is the process of rerecording the vocal performance in an audio studio. Generally the video image will be played while the audio engin
Why is Supernatural coming to an end after 15 seasons?
 There are story reasons but it＊s most likely business driven. AT&T bought Warner last year. They＊re restructuring it this year. They＊re launching a WarnerMedia streaming service next year. Right now, the CW shows are more or less bankrolled by Netflix pa

Why is reading considered more intellectual than watching film or TV?
 Partly snobbery: for a very long time, reading was something only the well educated/rich people did. Your average peasant had neither the time nor the money to learn it, and no books to read anyway. So, reading (and owning) books was a way to display you

Which has a better picture quality for watching movies, a monitor or small TV?
 Either work well. High Definition works well on large screens, but on small screens there＊s not a huge difference. I even watch on a tablet, shows on Netflix, and considering that＊s inches from my face, compared to my 32∪ tv which is 7每8 feet away, I don
What effect do you think film and television violence has on people in society?
 I am sure it has a bad effect. In the 1970s there was much less graphic violence on screen. When people fought it was often over quite quickly. Nowadays some screen violence is more brutal and is very detailed and sustained and this must affect people wh
Which live-action television show or movie would you love to watch in a animated version?
 For me, it＊s a close tie between two I think would be hysterical in animated form: Impractical Jokers (2011-) A show about four comedic friends, daring each-other to do whatever the other tells them or otherwise suffer the humiliating and/or painful puni

What TV show do you believe has the best ending ever?
 I would say it was Breaking Bad. I expected the last episode to be a train-wreck trying to tie up all the sub-plots but instead was pleasantly surprised by a very satisfying ending. I would say the worst ending was St. Elsewhere. It turned out the show,
